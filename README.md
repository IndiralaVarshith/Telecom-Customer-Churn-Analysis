📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
This project focuses on understanding and predicting customer churn within a telecom company. Customer churn refers to when a customer discontinues service. Gaining insights into churn patterns allows companies to improve retention and enhance customer satisfaction.

🎯 Objective
The key objectives of this project are to:

Analyze trends and patterns that contribute to customer churn.

Visualize the main factors influencing churn behavior.

Build a predictive model to estimate each customer’s likelihood of churning.

Deliver actionable insights and strategic recommendations to reduce churn.

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes a range of customer information, categorized as:

Demographic Data: Gender, Senior Citizen status, Partner, Dependents

Service Data: Phone Service, Internet Service, Online Security, Streaming TV, etc.

Account Data: Contract Type, Payment Method, Monthly Charges, Tenure

Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)

🚀 Key Features Implemented
🔍 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values appropriately.

Transformed categorical features into numerical form using encoding techniques.

Formatted data for consistency and model readiness.

📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted visual analysis using pie charts, bar plots, and heatmaps.

Identified churn trends based on tenure, contract type, and payment method.

📉 3. Model Building & Evaluation
Developed a Logistic Regression model to predict churn.

Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

📈 4. Data Visualizations
Pie chart showing churn distribution.

Bar plots comparing features like tenure and contract with churn rate.

Heatmap displaying correlations among key features.

📤 5. Final Output
Exported a CSV file (LTV_predictions.csv) containing churn probability scores for each customer.
